-- We join the Views table with itself (a and b aliases) on the condition that the author_id of a matches the viewer_id of b and the article_id is the same in both rows.
-- The WHERE clause ensures that we only consider rows where the author_id is equal to the viewer_id, indicating that the author viewed their own article.
-- We use DISTINCT to ensure each author is only listed once in the output.
