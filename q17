-- Write an SQL query that reports the products that were only sold in the first quarter of 2019. That is,
-- between 2019-01-01 and 2019-03-31 inclusive.
-- Return the result table in any order.

-- The main SQL query is written using a common table expression (CTE) named cte. 
-- This CTE selects product_id, product_name, and sale_date from the sales table, joining it with the product table
-- to get the product names. It filters the results to include only sales between January 1, 2019, and March 31, 2019.

-- Subquery in WHERE Clause Within the main query, there's a subquery in the WHERE clause.
-- This subquery selects the maximum sale date for each product ID from the sales table and filters the results 
-- based on whether the sale date matches the maximum sale date for each product ID.

-- The query selects product_id and product_name from the CTE cte where the sale_date matches the maximum sale date for each product ID,
-- indicating products that were only sold in the first quarter of 2019.
